## MEATLESS

## THE WHAT

*Our teams idea was to create an app that, when a user was out enjoying a meal and they decided they did not want to eat
meat a particular meal. They could then enter the weight of the meat they would otherwise had eaten and find out how much
that meal of meat could save the environment in terms of C02, water etc and also see the history of their savings.*

## THE MVP

Create page templates
Create Routes
Build database
R/D formulas for results
Boilerplate
CSS


## THE USER STORY

*As a user I want...
  to select my name in the drop down and enter meat details
  to select meat type and enter amout in grams 
  to view savings per meal
  to see history of savings*
